# parseSentance
Parse a sentence by taking each word and showing first character, distance between first and last, last character. 

This is done by first splitting the sentance into an array of words.  Then it gets split into an array of characters.  From there it test for duplicate characters.  Removes the duplicate characters.  Counts how many letters are in-between the word.  Than outputs the sentance with first letter, count, and last letter.

Ex.  "Justin likes pools" would be J4n l3s p2s.
